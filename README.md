 import keypad.*
 ```
 
 You can examine the implementation of the `KeyPadPane.java`, but should **NOT** modify the contents of the file when using it in your assignment(s).
 
 # `TestKeyPadPane.java`
 The `TestKeyPadPane.java` file shows a quick demo of using this custom Pane.  This should not just be copied and pasted for the assignment.  It is only intended as an example.
